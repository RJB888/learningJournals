# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Dear Diary.....

What an insane day!!!  After only getting almost 5 hours of sleep it was pretty rough going over objects and the DOM.  It went way deeper than I expected, and I was hard-pressed to follow along.  Normally pretty wizard at the JS, I stared dumbly at the page, making stupid errors.  Note to self - SLEEP!!  Anyway.  I got it pretty sorted now.

p.s - CSS is the devil!
