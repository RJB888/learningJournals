# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

Interesting day.  Most of what we went over was review for me, but putting it all together with the requirements for the lab is twisting my mind a little.  I find it hard to think with git and having to add and commit all the time.  I work better planning everything out and then coding it all at once, and if I do that, then I will not have a breadcrumb trail in git that seems to be desired by the instructors.  Have to figure out how to sort through that so I can merge my standard problem solving strategy with how its expected to "look" here.
