# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

Well... day 5.  Felt really good about today's assignment, got through the code fairly quickly, felt like I wrote some pretty efficient JS.

Spent some time helping other students understand the git branching and merging process.  Helps me to solidify my understanding of the process too.  

Spent a LOT of time helping another student understand functions, how they are called, arrays and how they work....  I feel like they don't have a solid grasp of the basics, and could really use some extra assistance.  I hope they get help and keep up with the class.

Worried about finishing and posting my about-me, as it has to be re-tooled... pretty much from scratch.  I am planning to work on the extra credit stuff that's  due on sunday, mostly so I can get experience working with CSS.
