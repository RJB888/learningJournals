# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

Today was hard.  I feel like we went backwards.  Its hard to listen to someone tell you to re-write your code because they don't like the output, especially when your code works just fine.  It works EXACTLY like its supposed to.  Exactly.  Anyway, we dodged that bullet by looking at the other way to do it and deciding we didn't want to go that route.  And then after I left, I got messages on slack saying that the master branch got messed up and some other part of the code isn't working.  FML.
