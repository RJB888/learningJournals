# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Day 8.  For some reason I keep going through the lectures thinking.. yeah I totally get this, and then getting to the lab and having to pore back over my notes and the demo code to make sure I'm doing it right.
I feel really shaky on the whole harvesting data from a form, and using event handlers.  I was able to follow Nick as he went through everything... but doing it on my own, I found myself really uncertain.  Probably because there are so many other variations and options to these concepts that I feel like I can only duplicate what was done in class.  I don't have any real grasp of it to branch off and "make it my own" but maybe that just comes with practice.

Was nice to see Nick doing some of the things I suggested in our one-on-one, stepping through and narrating some of the processes that he would normally blaze through quickly out of habit.
