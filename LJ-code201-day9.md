# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Day 9,

Thought I had this one in the bag.  The CSS task was simple in scope, but implementation was troublesome.  Took the quiz.... 4 times... some of those answers are too ambiguous.  Like the (  ) of a function doesn't load until the interpreter gets to that line... well TBH since JS isn't a compiled language... NOTHING runs until the interpreter gets to that line.  The declaration doesn't happen until the interpreter gets to that line.... the invocation doesn't happen until the interpreter gets to the line of code that invokes it... the expression doesn't fire until the interpreter gets to that line... WTF ? I call "foul" on that one.  
Anyway, I felt like I was doing well implementing the css, it just took forever.  I had the html laid in, and some of my css working before I left the school, then spent 4 hours at home tweaking and adjusting things.  And its still ugly.  Not because my CSS is bad, but because I suck at designing pretty things.  I am not an artist.
