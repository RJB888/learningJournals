# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

Day 17 = how do fix broken code.  Spent many many hours chasing bugs around the code... fix it here, and something else would pop up there.  Found that it helps a lot to follow the logic of your code and look at why it would be producing the results it is... sometimes it turns out your code is doing exactly what you told it to... you just arent feeding it the data you wanted it to have.  
I feel like we are so far behind on this thing...It kinda works now.. barely.  But it is still ugly as sin.  Tomorrow will be time to polish the turd.
