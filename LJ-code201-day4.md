# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Yet another day down.  Today went better than yesterday.  Did pair programming today.  The actual programming part was easy, just wrapping code into functions.  Git functionality still seems to be the major stumbling block.  We seem to be introduced to a new piece every day, and still haven't really figured out what the things we learned previously are doing.  Very frustrating.

Spent too many hours last night trying to style my page.  Learned that I suck really bad at CSS.  Mostly because my sense of design is crap.  I think I need to start over on my page and plan it out and wireframe it, completly redo it.

Hoping that tonight's homework won't be too intensive.  I would like to have a little time to relax.......
