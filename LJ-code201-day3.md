# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Felt better going into today.  Helped a few students figure out how to add commit and push with git.  Hate the box model - padding and margins make me crazy.  Got poor marks on Day 2 lab.  Even though I put responses to user input in there, I didn't use alert() so I got points taken off... crazy, especially since we aren't even going to be using alerts after this week... :(

I also think that the labs are a little too vague in their directions.  I had trouble sorting out exactly what was wanted in the html doc, so my submission (while it had all the technical points down) was apparently missing some content that I did not understand as being required.  

Having to re-do work from previous days is hurting my time-management.  I spent valuable hours trying to fix yesterday's work before I realized that the due date for today's lab is more important, as I can fix the previous lab at any time.. but I need to get today's lab done and submitted - today.  I also spent time debugging my neighbor's code, and while that helps me in being able to spot bugs.. it doesn't forward my progress at all.

I don't understand the purpose of the continuously changing submission requirements, as in one day we submit the URL for the actual document, and the next day we have to submit some kind of other link...not sure if these changes are being thrown in just to knock us "off balance" and keep us scrambling, or if they serve some purpose.

I feel like we are being under-prepared for the CSS requirements on this course.  We continue to "learn" CSS in the instruction portion of the class, but our labs are never CSS heavy in their instructions, like there are no set style requirements for us, merely a "put in whatever CSS you're comfortable with" which doesn't give me a warm&fuzzy about styling.  Especially since styling is my weak point anyway.... :(

Thats all for now.. i guess.
