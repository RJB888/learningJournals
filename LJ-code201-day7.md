# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today went fine.  Had my one-on-one with Nick.  He's good people.  The code project for today went fine, managed to get the logic worked out for the most part on my own.  It was interesting sorting out how to insert things into the table in rows.  Once again I had trouble with the CSS.  I'm not sure if its a clarity of instructions sort of thing, or if its me not understanding things.  Our instructions were to have functions to create and insert the header and footer for the cookie store table... so I assume the table should have a head, body, and footer.  But then the instructions said to have every other row colored, and the demo table showed the "footer" portion colored.  I couldn't for the life of me get my css to include the "footer" when doing the coloring.  It also doesn't count the header (in case anyone is counting....) so I wasn't sure what to do with that... we'll see how the grading goes...
