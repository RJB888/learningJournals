# LJ Code 201 - Day 16

Today was strange.  It was weird not having lecture and being left to our own devices.  We spend a good portion of the day planning out the project, and then tried to code it.
The coding went strangely.  I felt like I knew nothing again... My code seemed to tie itself in knots... and not just when we had a merge party. Though I did lose some code after a merge party and had to figure out exactly which bits of code I lost, and put them back... not fun.
I hope we don't tank this project.  It would be sad to do well all through the course and then have the final project keep me from passing....

Back to it..
