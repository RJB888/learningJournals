# LJ Code 201 - Day 18

Not sure what to write for today.  Everything feels like its winding down.  Starting to look ahead to 301.  Wondering what things I could do in the week off to prepare for 301.  I'm a little worried about 301 tackling things I'm unfamiliar with at the same pace we tackled 201 with.... its going to suck.  I'd feel better if there was some stuff I could study to get me prepared.
