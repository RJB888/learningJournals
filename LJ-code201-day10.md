# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Feeling a little Twilight Zone going on right now.  Since I was able to keep up with the cookie store project, it seems like I don't have much homework to do... but that feeling is scary, because something inside me is yelling: "You HAVE to have homework... you are MISSING something!!!!!!"

Felt better doing the paired programming assignment today.  The CSS went much smoother than anticipated.  Though I was actually surprised Nick didn't pair people who were struggling with people who were doing well.  Maybe everyone is on about the same level CSS wise... maybe if it had been a JS project that would have been beneficial...
