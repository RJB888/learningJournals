# LJ Code 201 - Day 14

Today was a git disaster!  Paired programming with 3 people working on the same files... we managed to hose everything up.  Could not figure out how to push up different work without causing errors in git making it so we weren't able to merge anything... what a mess.

The coding went better than I expected. We each worked on parts of it, and then merged our pieces together and worked out the kinks.  Its ugly... but it works.
