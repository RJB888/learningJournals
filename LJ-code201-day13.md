# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Today went well until I tried to do the "touch-up" on my charts.  
Started off with paired programming.. which went surprisingly well.  I of course tried to be over complicated with new variables and passing values back and forth... then my partner suggested we just store the whole array of products... and well... duh.. it worked.  That all went swimmingly.... then I got home.
I tried to addd a second chart... could NOT get it to work.  Kept getting concat on undefined errors... eventually gave up on that.... so I decided to just put in another dataset on my bar chart (that was already working well... if I must say).  Once I added in the new dataset... you guessed it.... it mucked up the works.  Somehow my data for my avg. is always equal to the times shown... and its a float... wtf ?!?!?!?!?!!!!

Got some style done.  Going to call it good.  Work on it tomorrow with the help of my "dev team".
