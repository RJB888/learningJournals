# LJ Code 201 - Day 12

Well crap.  Realized when I got home that I forgot to turn in the LJ for yesterday..... lost points... So, for today, I managed to get to where I should have been last night.  I have my photos changing and counting properly.  Now I have figure out how to implement chart JS at home.. .on my own... just me and the docs.... and Google. (Google knows all...).  Still waiting for the other shoe to drop.. this week its seemed like we haven't really covered anything significantly difficult.
