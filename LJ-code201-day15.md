# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Hello last day of learning.  Today was interesting, I got to see how well my project team worked together.  It went well.  We were all able to present ideas, and no one tried to dominate the project.  Everyone respected everyone else's views.  It looks like its going to go well.
The lecture went oK, Nick seemed to get too much enjoyment out of showing us all the shortcuts that we had spent the last 2 weeks learning how to do the long way.  Not much else to say.  I don't think our project is going to hit the bar set by the Banana Beat project...but let's face it.. that's a pretty high bar.
